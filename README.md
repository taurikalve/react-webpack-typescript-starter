# React Webpack

React Webpack with TypeScript development platform, similar to CRA. Includes **react-refresh**.

---

## Notes

Currently includes both CSS and SCSS - remove as necessary.

---

## Issues

- `browserlist.development` breaks **react-refresh** with current version of **webpack-dev-server**. Add later: `"development": [ "last 1 chrome version", "last 1 firefox version", "last 1 safari version" ]`
